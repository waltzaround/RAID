      <h1><strong>RAID</strong> - Responsible AI Disclosure</h1>
      <p class="pad">
        With the advent of easily accessible and usable “artificial
        intelligence” or models such as ChatGPT and Midjourney, more and more
        work is being produced almost entirely by so-called “AI”.<br /><br />

        Given the wide social and commercial interest in these models and their
        outputs, the profound ethical implications of AI use, and the potential
        impacts on employment, human agency, and society at large, there is an
        urgent need for labelling of work that has been created with AI.
        <br /><br />Experts have warned that — thanks to the proliferation of
        software making use of AI APIs and open-source AI models — the internet
        is being swamped with AI-generated content that readers (and search
        engines!) find hard or impossible to distinguish from human-created
        content. <br /><br />
        What’s more, there is an urgent need for creators to be able to
        watermark or otherwise disclose the fact that AI was not used in their
        work’s creation. For many creators, announcing that their work was not
        made by or with the help of AI is becoming increasingly popular.
        <br /><br />They know their audiences and customers see more value in
        content that was created by humans. A watermark or disclosure that can
        be used widely across work where AI was not used in its creation will
        aid this effort. <br /><br />
        For a transparent solution that helps viewers, users and purchasers of
        digital works understand how AI was (or wasn’t) used in the creative
        process, we propose the following digital disclosures or AI “licences”.
        <br /><br />
        We call this <i>Responsible AI Disclosure</i>, or <strong>RAID.</strong>

      <h2>How to use the RAID and NO-AI licenses / disclosures.</h2>
      <p>
        These disclosures can be downloaded from this website and used to
        identify to users or viewers of a given piece of content or artwork when
        or how AI was used in the work’s creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We urge the creators of AI applications to include these disclosures as
        watermarks or downloadable assets on directly AI-generated content, for
        example when copying and pasting from ChatGPT.

      <h2>Potentially Asked Questions (PAQ)</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Disclosure or licence?</h3>
      <p>
        We’ve used the term “licence” in a cheeky riff on the fact that, in the
        commercial-creative world, when a commercial entity wants to use work
        made by another creative — for example, music, or piece of art — they
        are required to licence it. This typically means an exchange of money or
        services. The creative is compensated for their work, and the
        corporation may use the work within agreed-upon bounds.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        AI, currently, is different. AI has been trained on the work of humans
        who, in almost all cases, did not give permission or intend for their
        work to be used in this way. The artefacts “created” by AI are merely a
        kind of regurgitation, often (correctly) referred to in jest as “spicy
        autocomplete”. There is an argument that this method of training and
        output represents mass plagiarism or theft. Getty Images certainly seems
        to think so.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Be aware that RAID “licences” are not real licences and have no legal
        effect in the current, almost regulation-free, AI environment. However,
        they are real disclosures. We encourage those who have (and haven’t)
        used AI in the creation of work to use them. We also like to think that
        one day — hopefully soon — there will be a legal framework in place that
        requires disclosure of the extent to which AI was used in the creation
        of a work.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>
        This is a cool project. Can I alter it, or build on what you’ve started?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Please do. The RAID/NO-AI concept is licensed under a Creative Commons
        CC BY-SA 4.0 licence and we encourage development and remixing.
        Iterations we would love to see include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Automatic inclusion of RAID disclosures in content created by LLMs
          like ChatGPT and automatic watermarking in AI image generators like
          Midjourney.
        </li>
        <li>
          Digital disclosures in the form of identifying metadata that search
          engines can use to classify content created (or heavily assisted by)
          AI. Work (created after a certain date) that does not include this
          metadata could be tagged as such in search engine results, or
          downranked.
        </li>
        <li>
          Disclosure on TikTok / Instagram filters that were created with AI.
        </li>
        <li>
          Disclosure on social media posts — looking at you, LinkedIn — where
          users have used AI to create posts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remixing or creating new icons for the different disclosure “licence”
          categories.
        </li>
        <li>We’re sure you can think of many, many more.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Are you anti-AI? </h3>
      <p>No. There is much in AI technology that promises to be helpful or even transformative. The creators of this site have both used AI. We are advocates for transparency in the use of AI, of the responsible use and development of AI, and of thoughtful regulation of the technology.</p><p> We encourage the creators of AI tools, like Open AI, Google, Meta, Stable Diffusion, and others, to incorporate or otherwise use this framework (or a derivative of it, under the terms of the Creative Commons CC BY-SA 4.0 licence) so their users can transparently disclose when work was created by their AI-powered products. 
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Why disclose AI involvement in a given piece of work?  </h3>
    <p>Labelling, disclosures, and licences have a long history and their use is critical for enabling not only informed consumer choice but supply-chain tracking and safety. For instance, it’s required that clothing be labelled by its country of origin. Other activities that have substantial downsides but are still considered vital for societal functioning and economic activity also require licences. </p><p>For instance, many countries require drivers to be licensed. If, as seems likely, content is to be produced by AI at scale, why should that activity not be identified? 
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <h3>How is this useful for artists, writers, and other creators?  </h3>
  <p>It is rapidly becoming important and useful for artists and writers to disclose when their creations were not made by AI. An example is the No AI Art movement that took place across artist social media like Instagram and Tumblr. We believe that specifically identifying work as not being assisted by AI will make that work more valuable and noteworthy in a world where an increasing volume of content is AI-generated.</p><p> We envisage use of these disclosures / licences in, for example, the front matter of a book where copyright information is currently displayed, or on websites or social media apps where creative work is hosted. 
</p>
<hr/>
<h3>I don’t want people knowing something was made with AI!   </h3>
<p>That’s not a question, but why not? Does that devalue it somehow? 🤔
</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Did you use AI to make this site or content?  </h3>
<p>No. If we had, it would be like rain on our wedding day. The draft copy was written in Google Docs, and the draft designs done in Figma. As we wish to be the first users of the RAID licence/disclaimer we’ve invented, let it be known that all content on this site is created under RAID-C.
