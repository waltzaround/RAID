        <h1><strong>RAID</strong> - Responsible AI Disclosure </h1>
        <p class="pad">With the advent of easily accessible and usable “artificial intelligence” or models such as
            ChatGPT and
            Midjourney, more
            and more work is being produced almost entirely by so-called “AI”.<br /><br />

            Given the wide social and commercial interest in these models and their outputs, the profound ethical
            implications of AI
            use, and the potential impacts on employment, human agency, and society at large, there is an urgent need
            for labelling
            of work that has been created with AI. <br /><br />Experts have warned that — thanks to the proliferation of
            software
            making use of
            AI APIs and open-source AI models — the internet is being swamped with AI-generated content that readers
            (and search
            engines!) find hard or impossible to distinguish from human-created content.
            <br /><br />
            What’s more, there is an urgent need for creators to be able to watermark or otherwise disclose the fact
            that AI was not
            used in their work’s creation. For many creators, announcing that their work was not made by or with the
            help of AI is
            becoming increasingly popular. <br /><br />They know their audiences and customers see more value in content
            that was
            created by
            humans. A watermark or disclosure that can be used widely across work where AI was not used in its creation
            will aid
            this effort.
            <br /><br />
            For a transparent solution that helps viewers, users and purchasers of digital works understand how AI was
            (or wasn’t)
            used in the creative process, we propose the following digital disclosures or AI “licences”.
            <br /><br />
            We call this <i>Responsible AI Disclosure</i>, or <strong>RAID.</strong>
